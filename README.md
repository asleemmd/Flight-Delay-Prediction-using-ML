Flight Delay Prediction using Data Analysis & Machine Learning

This project explores flight delay prediction using real-world aviation datasets. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to delays and build predictive models for improved airline operations and passenger planning.

Key Highlights

Performed extensive data cleaning & preprocessing, handling missing values and outliers.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA): delay distributions, peak delay times, airport-wise trends, and airline performance.

Engineered features such as departure time, day-of-week, carrier, and weather conditions.

Implemented and evaluated multiple ML models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XG Boosting

Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

SQL for query-based data analysis

Applications

This work demonstrates how data science and ML can support airline operations, traffic management, and passenger experience by predicting potential delays before they occur.
